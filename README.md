MCK: The St Mint Construction Kit
=================================

A proof of concept to build an Atari ST Mint distribution using Ansible as a build tool.

Having ansible and a POSIX make installed, call

```
make ansible
```

then copy the content of the /target dir to a Atari ST disk image.
You can find a ready to use disk image at https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/hd80mb.image.gz
