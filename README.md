MCK: The ST Mint Construction Kit
=================================

A proof of concept to build an Atari ST Freemint distribution using Ansible as a build tool.
Freemint is an Unix-like kernel for the Atari ST, see https://freemint.github.io/ for details

## Ready to use disk images for your Atari
See http://www.subsole.org/st_mint

## Dependencies
You will need a Linux system the following packages installed:
- ansible
- mtools
- pmake
- mksh (or maybe ksh)
from the Debian / Ubuntu archive

and
- cross-mint-essential
- zlib-m68k-atari-mint
from Vincent Rivi√®re's m68k-atari-mint cross-tools

## Usage

First make sure you pulled the minix git submodule:

```
git submodule update --init
```

To build the distribution:

```
pmake
```

To create an Atari AHDI partitioned disk image with the distribution

```
pmake install
```

To copy the distribution in a partition mounted on /stmint, call
```
pmake cardinstall
```
