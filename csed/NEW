CSed - a cheap sed implementation

This is yet another descendent of the small-sed written ages ago by 
Eric S. Raymond.  He described the original version thus:

  This is a smaller, cheaper, faster SED utility.  Minix uses it.  GNU used
  to use it, until they built their own sed around an extended (some would
  say over-extended) regexp package.

While trying to keep it small, cheap and fast, my goals were to:
- convert it to a more modern C dialect
- be compliant with the modern POSIX sed recommendation
I started from HHSed (also known as sed 1.5), the last known descendant of 
small-sed at the time. It turns out that I had to remove a number of HHsed
'extensions' that I personnally consider either useless or harmful. I hope I
haven't betrayed the intentions of the original authors in doing so.

Licence
-------

This is distributed under the GPL version 2 or later at your option.
(see http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)
It seems to me that doing this is coherent with 
1) the fact that Sed-1.3 itself was released under the GPL in 1998;
2) the wishes of authors of HHsed:

  You, Dear Reader, may do *anything* you wish with it except steal it.

Features
--------

I've tried to remove as many extensions to POSIX as I could. 
Remaining differences are:
- \t, \n, \a, \b, ..., \xdd are recognised in REs (including in bracket 
  expressions), the RHS of substitutions, text argument of i\, a\, c\, 
  and y command.
- \+ in a RE is a synonym of \{1,\}, \? a synonym for \{0,1\}
- \< and \> match beginning and end of word respectively
- collation-related bracket symbols (like [:digit:], [=a=] and [.[.] 
  in bracket expressions) are not recognised
Optional behaviour:
- sub-expressions are not anchored: /\(^a\)/ does match /\^a/, not /^a/
- "a**" is considered as "a*\*", "a*\{2\}" as "a*{2}"

Limitations
-----------

I'm currently removing as many limitations as I can. Still the current version
handles:
- no more that 20 levels of { ... } nesting
- less than 10 writeout files
- in "\{n\}", "\{n,\}" and "\{n,m\}" n and m must be <= 32767
- matched \( ... \), when repeated, must be less than 32767 bytes away in
  compiled form.

Bug reports are welcome by mail at <lvl@club-internet.fr>.


How to install
--------------

1) edit the Makefile to select your C compiler
2) type "make". This should build a sed executable called sed in
   the curent directory.
optional:
3) type "make test". If nothing but "Testing foo" prints, the test foo 
   runs successfully (else a copy of the failure report is in foo.log)
4) copy the sed executable at your preferred location

That's it for documentation! I didn't include other HHsed files as
I didn't have time to maintain them and as there is plenty of accurate
documentation available elsewhere, including the POSIX specs for free.
